# JavaFX Demo

These instructions assume that you have a working development environment with Visual Studio Code, Java, and git. Before proceeding, you should have the following:

- Visual Studio Code [set up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) with a Java Development Kit (JDK) and VS Code Java Coding Pack.
- Visual Studio Code set up with [GitHub](https://github.com/). Your local IDE should be able to clone, pull, push, and sync code to a remote repository.

If your local development environment meets the above criteria, you can proceed with the JavaFX install.

<br><br>

## 1. Determine Java or JDK version
First, verify the version of Java (or JDK) you have installed. You can do this by opening a terminal and running `java --version`. You should see something like the following:

```
java 23.0.1 2024-10-15
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 23.0.1+11-39)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0.1+11-39, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Here, we have Java Release 23 installed. Note this version number.

<br><br>

## 2. Download JavaFX
Go to the JavaFX website and [download](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) the appropriate installer package for your version of Java. Select the appropriate operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.) and the appropriate processor architecture. Download the JavaFX **SDK** package

Typically, Windows machines will have `x64` architecture. macOS machines with an Intel processor will be `x64`, whereas Apple Silicon processors (e.g. M1, M2, etc.) will be `aarch64`.

<br><br>

## 3. Install JavaFX Libraries
Open the zip file you downloaded above. You should have a folder with a name similar to `javafx-sdk-23.0.1`. 

Place this folder where you keep the rest of your local repo folders. You

## 4. Install Visual Studio Code extensions
In Visual Studio Code, go to the Extensions panel. Search for and install the extension called `JavaFX Support`.

## 5. Configure libraries in Visual Studio Code
Open the example [`HelloWorld.java`](src/basic/HelloWorld.java) program in this repo. You should see the JavaFX imports underlined in red. We need to configure the location of these libraries.

In the bottom left corner of your IDE, click on `Java Projects` > `Referenced Libraries` > `Add...`

Navigate to the `lib/` folder within the JavaFX libraries folder from **Step 3**. Add the entire library folder, or individually add all `.jar` files within it. 

Your project should now be set up like this:

## 6. Configure runtime modules in Visual Studio Code
Though the build libraries have now been located, your `HelloWorld.java` will still give the following error on execution:

`Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application`

First, we need to get the path to the JavaFX library folder.

### Get the path to the JavaFX library folder (macOS)
From **Step 3** above, get the path to the `lib/` folder found in your JavaFX download. Right-click the folder while holding the Option key to **copy the folder path**:

### Get the path to the JavaFX library folder (Windows)
From **Step 3** above, get the path to the `lib/` folder found in your JavaFX download. Right-click the folder while holding the Option key to **copy the folder path**:

### Configure runtime modules
With the code editor open to `HellowWorld.java`, go to the menu bar and click on `Run` > `Add Configuration...`

![screenshot](images/configuration.png)

You should now be looking at a configuration file `launch.json`. Find the section referencing `HellowWorld.java` and add to this section. 

**NOTE: Append a `,` comma after the last parameter before pasting the parameter below.**

Copy this code and replace the path to `lib/` with your own, from the step above:

```
"vmArgs": "--module-path /Users/yourname/Documents/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
```

Note that if your path has a space in it, you will need to **enclose the path** with **escaped quote** characters `\"` as follows:

```
"vmArgs": "--module-path \"/Users/yourname/My Documents/javafx-sdk-23.0.1/lib\" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
```

The configured path should look like this:

![screenshot](images/module.png)

Save and close the `launch.json` file.

<br><br>

## 7. Run your JavaFX program
Returning to `HelloWorld.java`, you should now be able to run the code:

![screenshot](images/helloworld.png)

Clicking the button should output text to your console.

Try running some other examples, including [`Login.java`](src/basic/Login.java) and [`BarChartApp.java`](src/charts/BarChartApp.java).

Note that running each program will require you to again configure the runtime modules on first execution (see **Step 6** above). Edit the `launch.json` file accordingly.

## 8. Explore other JavaFX examples
Explore the `src/com/jenkov/javafx` folder for examples of what you can do with JavaFX, sourced from [this repository](https://github.com/jjenkov/javafx-examples).
