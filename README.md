# JavaFX Demo

These instructions assume that you have a working development environment with Visual Studio Code, Java, and git. Before proceeding, you should have the following:

- Visual Studio Code [set up](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java) with a Java Development Kit (JDK) and VS Code Java Coding Pack.
- Visual Studio Code set up with [GitHub](https://github.com/). Your local IDE should be able to clone, pull, push, and sync code to a remote repository.

If your local development environment meets the above criteria, you can proceed with the JavaFX install.

## 1. Determine Java or JDK version
First, verify the version of Java (or JDK) you have installed. You can do this by opening a terminal and running `java --version`. You should see something like the following:

```
java 23.0.1 2024-10-15
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 23.0.1+11-39)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.0.1+11-39, mixed mode, sharing)
```

Here, we have Java Release 23 installed. Note this version number.

## 2. Download JavaFX
Go to the JavaFX website and [download](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) the appropriate installer package for your version of Java. Select the appropriate operating system (macOS, Windows, Linux, etc.) and the appropriate processor architecture.

Typically, Windows machines will have `x64` architecture. macOS machines with an Intel processor will be `x64`, whereas Apple Silicon processors (e.g. M1, M2, etc.) will be `aarch64`.

## 3. Install JavaFX
Open the zip file you downloaded above. You should have a folder with a name similar to `javafx-sdk-23.0.1`. 

Place this folder where you keep the rest of your local repo folders.

## 4. Install Visual Studio Code extensions
In Visual Studio Code, go to Extensions and search for and install the extension called `JavaFX Support`.
